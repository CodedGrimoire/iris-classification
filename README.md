Iris Flower Classification
This project uses a Random Forest model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their features, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

How It Works
The model is trained using the Iris dataset, and it predicts the species of the flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on the given features.
